Suppose the weights and biases are such that $w \\cdot x + b \\neq 0$ for the input $x$ to any particular perceptron in the network. Now replace all the perceptrons in the network by sigmoid neurons, and multiply the weights and biases by a positive constant $c > 0$.

    "4. An extreme version of gradient descent is to use a mini-batch size of just 1.

Then we choose another training input, and update the weights and biases again. And so on, repeatedly. This procedure is known as online, on-line, or incremental learning. In online learning, a neural network learns from just one training input at a time (just as human beings do).
